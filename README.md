# BC Real Estate

The BC Real Estate website is a landing page for our imaginary real estate company.
The user can explore all the different sections of the page, such as: the features section, the offer section, as well as interact with the map  and the social links at the bottom of the page.

The website is composed of three separate pages all displayed in the navigation bar of the landing page.
